According to AIDE man pages, the AIDE’s exit status is normally 0 if no errors occurred.
Except when the –check, –compare or –update command was requested, in which case the exit status is defined as:

1 * (new files detected?)     +

2 * (removed files detected?) +

4 * (changed files detected?)

Or the sum of all together like 1+2 = error 3
   
Additionally, the following exit codes are defined for generic error conditions:

14 Error writing error

15 Invalid argument error

16 Unimplemented function error

17 Invalid configureline error

18 IO error

19 Version mismatch error
